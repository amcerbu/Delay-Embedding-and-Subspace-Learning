# Audio Visualization via Delay Embedding & Subspace Learning

This is the code repository to accompany a submission to DAFx 2024. Included are three Jupyter notebooks and a C++ application.

- `Visualization.ipynb`: The main notebook, implementing the video-generation algorithms. 
- `Figures.ipynb`: A smaller notebook used to generate the figures in the Methods section of our paper.
- `Frequency.ipynb`: A self-contained notebook demonstrating the frequency-detection algorithm described in Appendix B.
- `Scope`: Source code for a realtime C++ visualization application. A demonstration video is available [here](https://youtu.be/Sl570aeDftM). The project depends on SDL, PortAudio, Eigen3, and RtMidi.
